# formulatookit source code repository

Hello, it you get there from pypi let me explain what it formulatoolkit...

It's a fork from py-expression-eval project, I added also a depdendecy resolver which can help in system of expressions. I put everything inside single classes, added exceptions objects and switched to pytest.
